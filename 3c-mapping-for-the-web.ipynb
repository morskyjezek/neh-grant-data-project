    "geospatial visualizations by mapping points on geoshapes. \n",
    "This notebooks moves on to create interactive, web-friendly maps, like Google Maps, that are \n",
    "likely more familiar to everyday users. \n",
    "The goal is to plot the grant information from the 1960s on a map background that allows zooming in and out,\n",

    "One way to do this is to use the leaflet.js javascript library, which will knit together the map tiles\n",
    "and the grant data. The map created will exist outside of this\n",

    "Leaflet is a library of tools, written in javascript, that help display geospatial information\n",
    "via web browsers. We will use regular approaches to web publishing to create, display, and share\n",
    "the map. These elements that power the map will include: \n",
    "\n",
    "* an HTML file that will pull in leaflet and create the basic page framework for the map\n",
    "* a javascript file that will use the leaflet tools to extract and load the geojson data \n",
    "* a CSS file to style and modify the display of the map\n",

    "The process is outlined in a clear and approachable way by Kim Pham in \"Web Mapping with Python and Leaflet,\" _Programming Historian_ 6 (2017), [doi:10.46430/phen0070](https://doi.org/10.46430/phen0070)."
