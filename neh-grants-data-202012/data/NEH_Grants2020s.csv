What was it like to grow up in this Cuba? How did leaders go from “teaching the work of the Revolution” to repression and exclusion?

Through four intertwined stories about a slave ship and its captives, two West African men, a financier, and a Kongolese prince, it investigates how illegal slavery thrived throughout the Atlantic World in general, and in Brazil in particular, in the very midst of the “Age of Emancipation.” In paying attention to the lived experiences of women, men, and children forced into, or who profited from, illegal slavery, this project challenges the predominant, sweeping narratives of the nineteenth-century as the triumph of abolition, free trade, and liberal freedom. Through an ethnographic reading of the archives of illegal slavery, this project weaves together the past and present, historical characters and archival encounters to propose a new way of writing about the ambiguous histories of slavery and freedom that centers the suffering and afterlives of the enslaved.",Research and writing leading to a book on illegal slavery in the 19th-century Atlantic World.,Latin American History,0,NULL,1,Yuko Miki [Project Director],3,"African History; Interdisciplinary Studies, Other; Latin American History"

My analysis shows how the doctrinal ideal of the disciplined householder as an ascetic-in-the-world provided a basis for treating Brahmin communities as comparable in holiness and authority to monastic orders. This principle justified Brahmins receiving patronage in the form of tax-free endowments and helped secure their families high social status by birth. Over the twelve months of the fellowship, I will finish the research and writing of the last three chapters of the book, which deal with the appropriation and transformation of this normative model on the peripheries beyond the north Indian “middle country”: in the Himalayan hills and Bengal, in the Tamil south, and in Indonesia.","Research and writing leading to a book on the history of Hindu law and the Brahmin class in south and southeast Asia, covering the years 300 BCE to 1000 CE.",History of Religion,0,NULL,1,Timothy Lubin [Project Director],2,History of Religion; South Asian History

I seek NEH funding to write this history, and reveal how presumably separate strands of ethnic and religious migrations in fact intersected. By exploring how competing state and philanthropic institutions sought to limit, channel, and instrumentalize these human migrations for their own purposes, I will recover a history that has often been distorted for ideological and national agendas.

Rywka Lipszyc (pronounced “Rivka Lipshitz”) recorded her innermost thoughts while the Third Reich directly oppressed her through forced labor, starvation, and the murder of her family. “Diary from the Ashes” will bring to life the talent and voice of this irrepressible young woman, who used her imagination to cope with the unimaginable.","Development

The states set their own terms for the admission, exclusion, and expulsion of foreigners, and for the movement of free blacks and enslaved persons. Only after slavery was abolished did the Supreme Court rule unequivocally that immigration was a federal matter. By this time, the Chinese were subject to the kinds of racial practices that had been used against free blacks in the antebellum era. To justify Chinese exclusion, the Supreme Court ruled in 1889 that federal authority over immigration resided in the inherent sovereignty of the nation, rather than any particular part of the Constitution. This doctrine has been the basis of U.S. immigration policy ever since.","Research and writing leading to a book on the interrelationship of immigration standards and slavery in federal policy, constitutional reform, and political action after the Civil War.",U.S. History,0,NULL,1,Kevin Kenny [Project Director],1,U.S. History

Largely ignored by historians of philosophy, Suchon is nevertheless one of the first Western thinkers to leave a substantial body of work devoted to developing a metaphysical account of freedom that is tied to women’s social, political and moral lives. Her key philosophical innovation was to argue that freedom for women requires that they choose what she calls “the neutral life,” foreswearing personal and professional relationships. I offer the first systematic treatment of Suchon’s philosophical system, showing how it offers new, feminist perspective on early modern treatments of human freedom. By placing Suchon in the context of feminist thought, I join the larger scholarly tradition, led by feminist historians, of giving women their proper place in intellectual history.","Writing of two chapters of a book on the

Looking at each statesman's views on economics, presidential power, war, the Constitution, natural rights, and populism we see that Lincoln was able to blend ideas of both founders to build better than either intended. As the nature of the founding-era conflicts still inhabit contemporary politics, we can prosper from appreciating Lincoln's fusion of the best of Jeffersonian and Hamiltonian ideas.","Writing a historical study comparing the political philosophies of Thomas Jefferson (president, 1743-1826), Alexander Hamilton (secretary of the treasury, 1757-1804), and Abraham Lincoln (president, 1809-1865).",Political Theory,0,NULL,1,Jon Schaff [Project Director],3,American Government; Political Theory; U.S. History

I study the collaboration of African, Caribbean, and British writers and artists and show how crossing disciplinary boundaries was crucial to undoing the colonial systems of knowledge and representation that underpin literary history and form.","Research and writing leading to a book on the

However, the rationalist justification of democracy is questioned by two major sources: first, by influential voices in late modern Continental political philosophy; second, by recent research in the field of American political science. On both fronts, a similar claim is made: namely, that liberal democratic political theory has failed to recognize that human beings are primarily “rationalizing” beings, rather than “reasoning” beings. I believe that political theorists need to take this claim seriously, so that we can consider with fresh eyes the question: to what extent are genuinely “rational” citizens required in order to have a properly functioning liberal democracy?","Writing two to three chapters of a book about the kind of reasoning

Throughout the 1800s, virtually all long works
of fiction by American writers featured first-person narration—an “I” or a “we”
telling the tale to the reader. But by the early years of the twentieth
century, an impersonal or “third-person” style of narration had become the
norm, and the appearance of the first-person “I” was deemed an offensive
authorial intrusion. Reading nineteenth-century American novelists
as members of a single family allows me to portray these narrative techniques
as a social project, developed among a community of readers and writers, rather
than as a series of isolated individual discoveries. “The First Person in
America” presents a literary history that connects the early preoccupation with
a democratic or private interiority, with the later development of an imperial
or corporate self. (Edited by staff)","Writing four chapters of&nbsp;a book on the evolution of

Arguing that these attitudes misrepresent the history of Judaism, Rabbinic Inferno: Hell in Classical Judaism produces the first scholarly book on afterlife retribution in the rabbinic era (70-700 CE).

field notebooks from more than a dozen languages. We will catalog and preserve
these materials; digitize the sound recordings, field notebooks, and other key
items; and provide online access as appropriate through the California Language

content by expanding a new prearchive process to facilitate community-based
metadata creation, cultural knowledge labeling, and recommendations for access.
